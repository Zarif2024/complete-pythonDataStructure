# Python Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of Python implementations of various data structures and algorithms.

## Contents

1. **Linear Data Structures**: These are data structures where the elements are arranged sequentially or linearly. Examples include arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues.

2. **Non-Linear Data Structures**: These are data structures where the elements are not arranged sequentially. Examples include trees and graphs.

3. **Algorithms**: Various algorithms implemented in Python. These include sorting algorithms, search algorithms, and more.

Each data structure and algorithm has a separate directory in the repository. In each directory, you will find:

- A `README.md` file that provides a definition of the data structure or algorithm.
- A Python file (`*.py`) that contains the implementation of the data structure or algorithm.

## Usage

To use any of the data structures or algorithms, simply import the relevant Python file into your code. For example, to use the stack data structure, you would do:

```python
